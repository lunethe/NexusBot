2. Add the Tampermonkey browser extension.

### Troubleshooting
- The menu is not showing up.
  - If on computer, make sure that Developer Mode is enabled in your browser's extensions page.
  - Try restarting your browser and/or device.
- The menu says the key is Invalid/Expired.
  - Make sure to input the entire license key. For example, if my license key was "Nexus-1d-abcdef", I would put "Nexus-1d-abcdef" into the box.
- It's getting all the answers wrong.
  - This is as intended if you have Auto Ungraded enabled as it automatically guesses for assignments that are only a completion grade.
  - On classes that have "ex", our AI has a tendency to be incorrect. We apologize for the inconvenience, and we are working on improving it.
- How do I get the menu to start doing my classes?
  - If you have all the features you want enabled, just press Next Activity on a class on the classes dashboard.
  - If you don't know what any of the features does, import a config from the configs channel in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/nexusbot).
